###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The result is going to be undefined because 'greetign' which I am trying to console log is not declared. as a javascript variable needs to be declared with proper variable declarations such as var, let or const. as greetign is not a variable and we are trying to console log it, it's going to return undefined.</i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>In this code block we are passing a number and a string to the sum function. in javascript if we try to add a number and a string instead of addition 'concatenation' takes place. as a result the value returned becomes a string. </i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>Here in this code block we have taken the value of the first index of food array and set it as the value of favouriteFood property inside info Object. now when we are using info.favouriteFood we are accessing the value of favoriteFood from the info object and modifying it. the food array remains unchanged.</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i>The answer is B that means undefined because when we declared the function we have taken a parameter name but when we are trying to console log the same function we didn't pass any arguments for the name parameter. as an empty variable always returns undefined name is returning undefined inside the function when it is called.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>In this codeblock when we are iterating through the nums array using forEach method for each num it should have added 1 to the count. but because we have a if condition which is checking for truthy or falsy the first element of the nums array which is 0 is not going to be counted as it is read as falsy.</i>
